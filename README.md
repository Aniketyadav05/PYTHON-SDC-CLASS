THE QUESTIONS FOR THE ASSESSMENT WERE AND MY SOLUTIONS ARE IN THE FILE:
1. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following
conditions
The number must be divisible by five If the number is greater than 150, then skip it
and move to the next number If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
Given:
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]

2. Write a program to calculate the sum of series up to n term. For example, if n =5
the series will become 2 + 22 + 222 + 2222 + 22222 = 24690

3.Write a program to find out the prime factors of a number.

4.Write a function prodDigits() that inputs a number and returns the product of digits of that number.

5.A number is called perfect if the sum of proper divisors of that number is
equal to the number. For example 28 is perfect number, since
1+2+4+7+14=28. Write a program to print all the perfect numbers in a given
range
